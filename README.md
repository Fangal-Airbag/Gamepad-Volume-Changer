# Gamepad Volume Changer
This plugin allows changes to the GamePad's volume! *(It's useful for when your volume slide might be broken.)*

## Building

To build this make sure you have [wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut) and [wups](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem) installed. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and use the resulting `.wps`.
